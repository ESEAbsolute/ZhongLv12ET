### Motivation

The inspiration for "ZhongLv-12ET" comes from a Boss mechanic in a DLC dungeon based on a [DLC pack](https://gitee.com/yulong-jiuqiu/panling) of [PAN-GU CONTINENT](https://pan-gu-continent.blogspot.com/) server, where players need to accurately identify note names to complete challenges.

This mechanic sparked the idea to develop a client-side mod that automatically recognizes and displays note information, making it easier for players to handle note-related tasks in the game.
